pyUmbral is a python implementation of David Nuñez's threshold proxy rencryption scheme: Umbral_.
Implemented with OpenSSL_ and Cryptography.io_, pyUmbral is a referential and open-source cryptography library
extending the traditional cryptological narrative of "Alice and Bob" by introducing a new actor,
*Ursula*, who has the ability to take secrets encrypted for Alice and *re-encrypt* them for Bob.
